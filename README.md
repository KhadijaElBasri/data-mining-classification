# Data Mining – Classification & Evaluation

## Overview

This repository contains a Data Mining project focused on supervised classification
and model evaluation on a structured dataset.

The objective is to build a complete data mining pipeline, from data preprocessing
and exploratory analysis to model training, evaluation, and comparison.

Several machine learning algorithms are implemented and evaluated using appropriate
performance metrics.

## Objectives

- Explore and preprocess a structured dataset
- Train multiple classification models
- Compare models using evaluation metrics
- Identify the most effective model for the task

## Techniques & Models

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Train-test split
- Classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
